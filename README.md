## Introduction

Using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB we build a Full Stack MERN Application . The App is called "Memories" and it is a simple social media app that allows users to post interesting events that happened in their lives.

With doing and practicing on this Memories-app  i acquired strong understanding of how the MERN Stack works.

All thanks to Adrian Hajdin - JavaScript Mastery which allowed me to realize this wonderful app <3

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the app

TODO: rename post message, refactor reducers, add some cool memories, maybe clickable tags, fix update functionality
